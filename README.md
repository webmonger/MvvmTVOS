# MvvmTVOS

This is an example app for a POC of MvvmCross implementation for TVOS

To get it working you need to clone https://github.com/webmonger/MvvmCross and build the TVOS projects then add all the dlls in the TVOS output folder to the MvvmTVOS.AppleTV

Add only Cirrious.CrossCore.dll, Cirrious.MvvmCross.Binding.dll, Cirrious.MvvmCross.dll and Cirrious.MvvmCross.Localization.dll in the core project
